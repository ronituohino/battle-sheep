# Week 4

**Project hours this week: 11**

This week I focused on rewriting the underlying board data structure to get rid of nested lists.
This gave the project quite a significant performance boost (~3x faster).

I improved the project structure and consistency based on the peer reviews.
I fixed some bugs that I had discovered, and some that the peer reviews reported.

### What I learned this week

I read more about hex grid functionality.
I read about transposition tables, I might implement those next week.

### Next up

Optimizing and improving the AI... (transposition tables)
Heuristic for selecting the starting tile.
More unit tests on some specific functions in game/ai.
Update documentation.
Clean the UI.
