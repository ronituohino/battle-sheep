## Playing the game

### Starting

You always get to choose the starting tile.
Click a marked tile to place your 16 sheep there.

The AI will then choose their starting tile.

### Moving sheep

To move your sheep, click on one of your sheep tiles and select an empty highlighted space.
Then select the amount of sheep you wish to move.

The AI will then make their move.

### Winning the game

The winner of the game is the one who controls most tiles on the board at the end of the game. The amount of sheep on top of a tile don't impact scoring.

The game ends when both players don't have any possible moves left.

You will then be presented with an ending screen telling which player won, or if you tied with the AI.
