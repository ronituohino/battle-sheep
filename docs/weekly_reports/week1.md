# Week 1

This week I focused mostly on the design document of this project.

I made the project base structure with React + Vite. I also made the deployment
pipeline to Firebase.

### What I learned this week

I learned about hexagonal coordinate systems.

I learned more about the differences of arrays and dictionaries. (Storing game
state in an array vs dictionary, array is a lot faster)

I learned about Firebase and their static site hosting.

**Project hours this week: 5**

My aim is to finish the essential UI (game config and game screen) next week and
make the game playable.
